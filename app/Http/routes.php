So bright<br/>

So bright<br/>

Conversations running through my head,<br/>

I’ll see you.<br/>

Moving mountains just to be ahead all the time<br/>

Is it worth it?<br/>

Now I’m stuck in this feeling ah-ah,<br/>

like I’m up on the ceiling so shy.<br/>

Cut it up to the recent silence,<br/>

don’t know whether to be mad or be silent.<br/>

If you suffer intrusions ah-ah,<br/>

let me get on the music so bright.<br/>

Don’t know if I’m a nuisance ah-ah,<br/>

but I’m tired of choosing alright.<br/>

Conversations running through my head,<br/>

I’ll see you.<br/>

Moving mountains just to be ahead all the time<br/>

Is it worth it?<br/>

Moving mountains<br/>

Moving mountains<br/>

Hey yeah<br/>

Hey yeah<br/>

All mine<br/>

All mine<br/>

Hey yeah<br/>

Hey yeah<br/>

Run high<br/>

Run high<br/>

There are so much we can learn from the universe<br/>

It is the frontier of our future<br/>

Twenty seconds<br/>

Moving mountains<br/>

Conversations running through my head,<br/>

I’ll see you.<br/>

Moving mountains just to be ahead all the time<br/>

Is it worth it<br/>

Moving mountains<br/>

Mountains<br/>

I’ll see you<br/>';
